# AI Scheduling Assistant
[assistant-opal.vercel.app](assistant-opal.vercel.app)

This tool is designed to take a simple free text input and update a user's events and tasks.

Most people's calendars are full of events, and they have long to-do lists. When something comes up, moving events around in your calendar, or planning time to dedicate to a task, can be a hassle. I designed this tool to reduce the stress that comes with trying to make a busy timetable work.

Built with Next.js, Gemini API, Google Calender API, Google Tasks API and OAuth.

Google Calendar and Tasks APIs are used to keep track of all events and tasks; as well as edit and modify events and tasks.

## Features
By simply sending a message, the user's assistant can:

- Add, modify or remove events
- Create and keep track of tasks
- Intelligently schedule events around due dates and other events
- Give scheduling advice
- Discuss future events
- These are examples, the system can be used in mulitple ways

## Disclaimer
No account information is stored anywhere. A Google account is only needed to access Google Calendar and Tasks.
