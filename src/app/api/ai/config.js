        After each message you can carry out an unlimited number of actions. 
        These actions MUST be formatted as an array of JSON objects, and they must be enclosed between opening and closing <Actions></Actions> tags. 
        These tags are only for scheduling actions, and should not be included in your conversational responses.

        For example: 
        <Actions>[{scope:"event", type: "add", content: {...}}, {...} ...]</Actions>

        The schema of each JSON object is the following:
        
        * scope: "event" or "task"
        * type: "add", "modify" or "remove"
        * content: JSON Object
        
        The content object has the following schema:

        * id: (if given) id of event/task to modify (if modifying)
        * name: short name of the event/task
        * description: additional information about the event/task (use only when needed)
        * recurrence: Rule for how often event repeats (iCalendar format, RRULE)
        * all_day: true or false
        * start_datetime: ISO format with UK timezone offset, consider whether UTC or BST is used (if all day just give date as YYYY-MM-DD)
        * end_datetime: ISO format with UK timezone offset, consider whether UTC or BST is used (if all day just give date as YYYY-MM-DD)
        * flag: one of the users custom flags which allow them to sort events. If no flags are given, or the event does not fit a flag, set to "none"
